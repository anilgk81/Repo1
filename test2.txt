How to Branch and Merge:

1. Create branch
	git branch "branch name"

2. checkout branch
	git checkout "branch name"

3. merge new branch in master branch
	git merge "branch name"
note: always checkout master and merge the branch to master

4. delete branch

	git push origin --delete "branch name"  - delete from remote
